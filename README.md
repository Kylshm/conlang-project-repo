# conlang-project-repo

The _conlang-project-repo_ keeps programs I make that aid me in my conlanging projects - mainly to delegate the tedious and repetitive part of conlanging.
More will be added as I come up with new ideas...

## Current ideas
- [ ] Custom romanisation system from IPA and vice versa
- [ ] Phonotactics checker - checks if a word agrees with set rules. Will flag words that do not conform.
- [ ] Output complete sentences from gloss (using [Leipzig glossing rules](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php))
- [ ] verb conjugator (person, tense, etc..)
